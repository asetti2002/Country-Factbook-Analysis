# Country-Factbook-Analysis

The dataset of 160 countries with ~40 characteristics such as debt, electricity consumption, Internet users, etc. The data set was updated in 2021. The first step of the cleaning will be to choose around 10 columns that we want to focus our analysis on. Then we will remove the null values in order to optimize the analysis. Check for duplicates. We will also choose our variables that we want to compare to analyze.

Analysis is done by @asetti2002 and @gsethupathy5
